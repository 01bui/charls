Style and Design
================

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this document is to record the basic style and design guidelines of CharLS to ensure consistency and 
to record decisions.


Tabs and Spaces
---------------
Spaces with an indent of 4. This to ensure maximum readability with different editors/platforms.


Exceptions and Error Handling
-----------------------------
* C++ Exceptions should be derived from std::exception. (Common accepted idom)
* The exception should be convertible to an error code to support the C API
* An english error text that describes the problem is extreme usefull.

=> Design: std::system_error is the standard solution to throw exceptions from libraries (CharLS is a library)
